## Abstract <br>

Social media has become an essential part of our lives, and with the proliferation of multivariate ideas and opinion circulating these websites, there exists an immense opportunity for us to analyze how consumers impact financial markets with their words. Even the recent trends suggest towards an increase in the impact of digital opinions on consumer decisions. “Deloitte (2007), for instance, finds that 82% of US Internet consumers report to be directly influenced by peer reviews in their purchasing decisions” [ ]. Having such studies in hand, it may safely be assumed that investors looking to increase the returns from the stock market may be swayed by the opinions and news appearing in relation thereto.
